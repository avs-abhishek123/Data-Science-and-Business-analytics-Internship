# Data-Science-and-Business-analytics-Internship

I am doing an internship in Data science and business analytics at The Sparks Foundation.It has been really a great experience, working at The Sparks Foundation. 
I was given the below tasks to implement & complete, in order to successfully complete the internship.

# TASK-1: Prediction using Supervised ML 
(Level - Beginner)
● Predict the percentage of an student based on the no. of study hours. 
● This is a simple linear regression task as it involves just 2 variables.
● You can use R, Python, SAS Enterprise Miner or any other tool 
● Data can be found at http://bit.ly/w-data
● What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/ day? 

# TASK -2 : Prediction using Unsupervised ML
(Level - Beginner)
● From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters 
and represent it visually. 
● Use R or Python or perform this task
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

# TASK-3: Exploratory Data Analysis - Retail
(Level - Beginner)
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘SampleSuperstore’ 
● As a business manager, try to find out the weak areas where you can 
work to make more profit. 
● What all business problems you can derive by exploring the data? 
● You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
● Dataset: https://bit.ly/3i4rbWl
● Beginner Level - Create dashboards. Screen-record along with your 
audio explaining the charts and interpretations.

# TASK-4: Exploratory Data Analysis - Terrorism
(Level - Intermediate)
● Perform ‘Exploratory Data Analysis’ on dataset ‘Global Terrorism’ 
● As a security/defense analyst, try to find out the hot zone of terrorism. 
● What all security issues and insights you can derive by EDA? 
● You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
● Dataset: https://bit.ly/2TK5Xn5
● Intermediate Level - Create storyboards. Screen-record along with 
your audio explaining the charts and interpretations. Use images.

# TASK-5: Exploratory Data Analysis - Sports
(Level - Advanced)

contributing win or loss of a team. 
● Suggest teams or players a company should endorse for its products. 
● You can choose any of the tool of your choice 
(Python/R/Tableau/PowerBI/Excel/SAP/SAS) 
● Dataset: https://bit.ly/34SRn3b
● Advanced Level - Create storyboards. Screen-record along with your audio 
explaining the charts and interpretations. Use annotations, animation and 
images.

# TASK-6: Prediction using Decision Tree Algorithm
(Level - Intermediate)
● Create the Decision Tree classifier and visualize it graphically. 
● The purpose is if we feed any new data to this classifier, it would be able to 
predict the right class accordingly. 
● Dataset : https://bit.ly/3kXTdox

# TASK-7: Stock Market Prediction using Numerical and Textual Analysis
(Level - Advanced)
● Objective: Create a hybrid model for stock price/performance 
prediction using numerical analysis of historical stock prices, and 
sentimental analysis of news headlines 
● Stock to analyze and predict - SENSEX (S&P BSE SENSEX)
● Download historical stock prices from finance.yahoo.com
● Download textual (news) data from https://bit.ly/36fFPI6
● Use either R or Python, or both for separate analysis and then 
combine the findings to create a hybrid model

# TASK-8: Timeline Analysis : Covid-19
(Level - Advanced)
● Create a storyboard showing spread of Covid-19 cases in your country or 
any region (Asia, Europe, BRICS etc) using Tableau, Power BI or SAP
● Use animation, timeline and annotations to create attractive and interactive 
dashboards and story
● Identify interesting patterns and possible reasons helping Covid-19 spread 
with basic as well as advanced charts
● Screen-record the completed storyboard along with your audio explaining the 
charts and giving recommendations.
● Dataset: Daily updated .csv file on https://bit.ly/30d2gdi
